	abstract = {Current {SLAM} back-ends are based on least squares optimization and thus are not robust against outliers like data association errors and false positive loop closure detections. Our paper presents and evaluates a robust back-end formulation for {SLAM} using switchable constraints. Instead of proposing yet another appearance-based data association technique, our system is able to recognize and reject outliers during the optimization. This is achieved by making the topology of the underlying factor graph representation subject to the optimization instead of keeping it ﬁxed. The evaluation shows that the approach can deal with up to 1000 false positive loop closure constraints on various datasets. This largely increases the robustness of the overall {SLAM} system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers.},

	abstract = {Semideﬁnite Programming ({SDP}) and Sums-of-Squares ({SOS}) relaxations have led to certiﬁably optimal non-minimal solvers for several robotics and computer vision problems. However, most non-minimal solvers rely on least squares formulations, and, as a result, are brittle against outliers. While a standard approach to regain robustness against outliers is to use robust cost functions, the latter typically introduce other non-convexities, preventing the use of existing non-minimal solvers. In this paper, we enable the simultaneous use of non-minimal solvers and robust estimation by providing a general-purpose approach for robust global estimation, which can be applied to any problem where a non-minimal solver is available for the outlier-free case. To this end, we leverage the Black-Rangarajan duality between robust estimation and outlier processes (which has been traditionally applied to early vision problems), and show that graduated nonconvexity ({GNC}) can be used in conjunction with non-minimal solvers to compute robust solutions, without requiring an initial guess. Although {GNC}’s global optimality cannot be guaranteed, we demonstrate the empirical robustness of the resulting robust non-minimal solvers in applications, including point cloud and mesh registration, pose graph optimization, and image-based object pose estimation (also called shape alignment). Our solvers are robust to 70-80\% of outliers, outperform {RANSAC}, are more accurate than specialized local solvers, and faster than specialized global solvers. We also propose the ﬁrst certiﬁably optimal nonminimal solver for shape alignment using {SOS} relaxation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03349},
	shorttitle = {Certifiable Outlier-Robust Geometric Perception},
	abstract = {We propose the ﬁrst general and scalable framework to design certiﬁable algorithms for robust geometric perception in the presence of outliers. Our ﬁrst contribution is to show that estimation using common robust costs, such as truncated least squares ({TLS}), maximum consensus, Geman-{McClure}, Tukey’s biweight, among others, can be reformulated as polynomial optimization problems ({POPs}). By focusing on the {TLS} cost, our second contribution is to exploit sparsity in the {POP} and propose a sparse semideﬁnite programming ({SDP}) relaxation that is much smaller than the standard Lasserre’s hierarchy while preserving exactness, i.e., the {SDP} recovers the optimizer of the nonconvex {POP} with an optimality certiﬁcate. Our third contribution is to solve the {SDP} relaxations at an unprecedented scale and accuracy by presenting {STRIDE}, a solver that blends global descent on the convex {SDP} with fast local search on the nonconvex {POP}. Our fourth contribution is an evaluation of the proposed framework on six geometric perception problems including single and multiple rotation averaging, point cloud and mesh registration, absolute pose estimation, and category-level object pose and shape estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that (i) our sparse {SDP} relaxation is exact with up to 60\%–90\% outliers across applications; (ii) while still being far from real-time, {STRIDE} is up to 100 times faster than existing {SDP} solvers on medium-scale problems, and is the only solver that can solve large-scale {SDPs} with hundreds of thousands of constraints to high accuracy; (iii) {STRIDE} provides a safeguard to existing fast heuristics for robust estimation (e.g., {RANSAC} or Graduated Non-Convexity), i.e., it certiﬁes global optimality if the heuristic estimates are optimal, or detects and allows escaping local optima when the heuristic estimates are suboptimal.},

	abstract = {In this work we present the ﬁrst initialization methods equipped with explicit performance guarantees that are adapted to the pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) and rotation averaging ({RA}) problems. {SLAM} and rotation averaging are typically formalized as large-scale nonconvex point estimation problems, with many bad local minima that can entrap the smooth optimization methods typically applied to solve them; the performance of standard {SLAM} and {RA} algorithms thus crucially depends upon the quality of the estimates used to initialize this local search. While many initialization methods for {SLAM} and {RA} have appeared in the literature, these are typically obtained as purely heuristic approximations, making it diﬃcult to determine whether (or under what circumstances) these techniques can be reliably deployed. In contrast, in this work we study the problem of initialization through the lens of spectral relaxation. Speciﬁcally, we derive a simple spectral relaxation of {SLAM} and {RA}, the form of which enables us to exploit classical linear-algebraic techniques (eigenvector perturbation bounds) to control the distance from our spectral estimate to both the (unknown) ground-truth and the global minimizer of the estimation problem as a function of measurement noise. Our results reveal the critical role that spectral graph-theoretic properties of the measurement network play in controlling estimation accuracy; moreover, as a by-product of our analysis we obtain new bounds on the estimation error for the maximum likelihood estimators in {SLAM} and {RA}, which are likely to be of independent interest. Finally, we show experimentally that our spectral estimator is very eﬀective in practice, producing initializations of comparable or superior quality at lower computational cost compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

Local convergence usually implies artifacts in map reconstruction and large localization errors, hence it is very undesirable for applications in which accuracy and safety are of paramount importance. We provide a technique to verify if a given 2D {SLAM} solution is globally optimal. The insight is that, while computing the optimal solution is hard in general, duality theory provides tools to compute tight bounds on the optimal cost, via convex programming. These bounds can be used to evaluate the quality of a {SLAM} solution, hence providing a “sanity check” for stateof-the-art incremental and batch solvers. Experimental results show that our technique successfully identiﬁes wrong estimates (i.e., local minima) in large-scale {SLAM} scenarios. This work, together with [1], represents a step towards the objective of having {SLAM} techniques with guaranteed performance, that can be used in safety-critical applications.},

In this paper, we extend our recent work on a convex optimization approach for hand-eye calibration to the case where one of the sensors cannot observe the scale of its translational motion (e.g., a monocular camera observing an unmapped environment). We prove that our technique is able to provide a certiﬁably globally optimal solution to both the known- and unknown-scale variants of hand-eye calibration, provided that the measurement noise is bounded. Herein, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the problem, show the tightness and stability of our convex relaxation, and demonstrate the optimality and speed of our algorithm through experiments with synthetic data.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) employ iterative nonlinear optimization methods to compute an estimate for robot poses. While these techniques often work well in practice, they do not provide guarantees on the quality of the estimate. This paper shows that Lagrangian duality is a powerful tool to assess the quality of a given candidate solution. Our contribution is threefold. First, we discuss a revised formulation of the {SLAM} inference problem. We show that this formulation is probabilistically grounded and has the advantage of leading to an optimization problem with quadratic objective. The second contribution is the derivation of the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem. The {SLAM} dual problem is a (convex) semideﬁnite program, which can be solved reliably and globally by off-the-shelf solvers. The third contribution is to discuss the relation between the original {SLAM} problem and its dual. We show that from the dual problem, one can evaluate the quality (i.e., the suboptimality gap) of a candidate {SLAM} solution, and ultimately provide a certiﬁcate of optimality. Moreover, when the duality gap is zero, one can compute a guaranteed optimal {SLAM} solution from the dual problem, circumventing non-convex optimization. We present extensive (real and simulated) experiments supporting our claims and discuss practical relevance and open problems.},

	title = {Pose Graph Optimization in the Complex Domain: Duality, Optimal Solutions, and Veriﬁcation},
	abstract = {Pose Graph Optimization ({PGO}) is the problem of estimating a set of poses from pairwise relative measurements. {PGO} is a nonconvex problem, and currently no known technique can guarantee the computation of a global optimal solution. In this paper, we show that Lagrangian duality allows computing a globally optimal solution, and enables to certify optimality of a given estimate. Our ﬁrst contribution is to frame {PGO} in the complex domain. This makes analysis easier and allows drawing connections with existing literature on unit gain graphs. The second contribution is to formulate and analyze the properties of the Lagrangian dual problem in the complex domain. Our analysis shows that the duality gap is connected to the number of eigenvalues of the penalized pose graph matrix, which arises from the solution of the dual. We prove that if this matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, then (i) the duality gap is zero, (ii) the primal {PGO} problem has a unique solution, and (iii) the primal solution can be computed by scaling an eigenvector of the penalized pose graph matrix. The third contribution is algorithmic: we leverage duality to devise and algorithm that computes the optimal solution when the penalized matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero. We also propose a suboptimal variant when the eigenvalues in zero are multiple. Finally, we show that duality provides computational tools to verify if a given estimate (e.g., computed using iterative solvers) is globally optimal. We conclude the paper with an extensive numerical analysis. Empirical evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases (100\% of the tests under noise regimes of practical robotics applications) the penalized pose graph matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, hence our approach allows computing (or verifying) the optimal solution.},

To address this challenge, in this paper we present an eﬃcient algorithm for solving the large-scale but low-rank semideﬁnite relaxations that underpin current certiﬁably correct machine perception methods. Our algorithm preserves the scalability of current state-of-the-art low-rank semideﬁnite optimizers that are custom-built for the geometry of speciﬁc machine perception problems, but generalizes to a broad class of convex programs over spectrahedral sets without the need for detailed manual analysis or design.

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) is the process of constructing a global model of an environment from local observations of it; this is a foundational capability for mobile robots, supporting such core functions as planning, navigation, and control. This article reviews recent progress in {SLAM}, focusing on advances in the expressive capacity of the environmental models used in {SLAM} systems (representation) and the performance of the algorithms used to estimate these models from data (inference). A prominent theme of recent {SLAM} research is the pursuit of environmental representations (including learned representations) that go beyond the classical attributes of geometry and appearance to model properties such as hierarchical organization, affordance, dynamics, and semantics; these advances equip autonomous agents with a more comprehensive understanding of the world, enabling more versatile and intelligent operation. A second major theme is a revitalized interest in the mathematical properties of the {SLAM} estimation problem itself (including its computational and informationtheoretic performance limits); this work has led to the development of novel classes of certiﬁable and robust inference methods that dramatically improve the reliability of {SLAM} systems in real-world operation. We survey these advances with an emphasis on their ramiﬁcations for achieving robust, long-duration autonomy, and conclude with a discussion of open challenges and a perspective on future research directions.},

In its conventional form, rotation averaging is stated as a minimization over multiple rotation constraints. As these constraints are non-convex, this problem is generally considered challenging to solve globally. We show how to circumvent this difﬁculty through the use of Lagrangian duality. While such an approach is well-known it is normally not guaranteed to provide a tight relaxation. Based on spectral graph theory, we analytically prove that in many cases there is no duality gap unless the noise levels are severe.

Examples of this class include the foundational problems of posegraph simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) (in robotics) and camera pose estimation (in computer vision), among others. This problem is typically formulated as a maximum-likelihood estimation that requires solving a nonconvex nonlinear program, which is computationally intractable in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to eﬃciently recover certiﬁably globally optimal solutions of this estimation problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semideﬁnite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides the exact {MLE} so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this semideﬁnite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graphtheoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and then design a Riemannian truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction eﬃciently.

Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph {SLAM} datasets shows that {SE}-Sync is capable of recovering globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics applications, and does so at a computational cost that scales comparably with that of direct Newton-type local search techniques.},

We argue that the computational complexity of the corresponding {SDDP} algorithm is almost the same as in the risk neutral case.},

	abstract = {The modeling of spatial discontinuities for problems such as surface recovery, segmentation, image reconstruction, and optical ﬂow has been intensely studied in computer vision. While “line-process” models of discontinuities have received a great deal of attention, there has been recent interest in the use of robust statistical techniques to account for discontinuities. This paper uniﬁes the two approaches. To achieve this we generalize the notion of a “line process” to that of an analog “outlier process” and show how a problem formulated in terms of outlier processes can be viewed in terms of robust statistics. We also characterize a class of robust statistical problems for which an equivalent outlier-process formulation exists and give a straightforward method for converting a robust estimation problem into an outlier-process formulation. We show how prior assumptions about the spatial structure of outliers can be expressed as constraints on the recovered analog outlier processes and how traditional continuation methods can be extended to the explicit outlier-process formulation. These results indicate that the outlierprocesses approach provides a general framework which subsumes the traditional line-process approaches as well as a wide class of robust estimation problems. Examples in surface reconstruction, image segmentation, and optical ﬂow are presented to illustrate the use of outlier processes and to show how the relationship between outlier processes and robust statistics can be exploited. An appendix provides a catalog of common robust error norms and their equivalent outlier-process formulations.},

	abstract = {Inverse kinematics ({IK}) is the problem of finding robot joint configurations that satisfy constraints on the position or pose of one or more end-effectors. For robots with redundant degrees of freedom, there is often an infinite, nonconvex set of solutions. The {IK} problem is further complicated when collision avoidance constraints are imposed by obstacles in the workspace. In general, closed-form expressions yielding feasible configurations do not exist, motivating the use of numerical solution methods. However, these approaches rely on local optimization of nonconvex problems, often requiring an accurate initialization or numerous re-initializations to converge to a valid solution. In this work, we first formulate inverse kinematics with complex workspace constraints as a convex feasibility problem whose low-rank feasible points provide exact {IK} solutions. We then present {CIDGIK} (Convex Iteration for Distance-Geometric Inverse Kinematics), an algorithm that solves this feasibility problem with a sequence of semidefinite programs whose objectives are designed to encourage low-rank minimizers. Our problem formulation elegantly unifies the configuration space and workspace constraints of a robot: intrinsic robot geometry and obstacle avoidance are both expressed as simple linear matrix equations and inequalities. Our experimental results for a variety of popular manipulator models demonstrate faster and more accurate convergence than a conventional nonlinear optimization-based approach, especially in environments with many obstacles.},

For each point, we are given (possibly noisy) measurements of its local coordinates in some of the coordinate systems. Alternatively, for each coordinate system, we observe the coordinates of a subset of the points. The problem of estimating the global coordinates of the N points (up to a rigid transform) from such measurements comes up in distributed approaches to molecular conformation and sensor network localization, and also in computer vision and graphics. The least-squares formulation of this problem, although nonconvex, has a well-known closed-form solution when M = 2 (based on the singular value decomposition ({SVD})). However, no closed-form solution is known for M ≥ 3. In this paper, we demonstrate how the least-squares formulation can be relaxed into a convex program, namely, a semideﬁnite program ({SDP}). By setting up connections between the uniqueness of this {SDP} and results from rigidity theory, we prove conditions for exact and stable recovery for the {SDP} relaxation. In particular, we prove that the {SDP} relaxation can guarantee recovery under more adversarial conditions compared to earlier proposed spectral relaxations, and we derive error bounds for the registration error incurred by the {SDP} relaxation. We also present results of numerical experiments on simulated data to conﬁrm the theoretical ﬁndings. We empirically demonstrate that (a) unlike the spectral relaxation, the relaxation gap is mostly zero for the {SDP} (i.e., we are able to solve the original nonconvex least-squares problem) up to a certain noise threshold, and (b) the {SDP} performs signiﬁcantly better than spectral and manifold-optimization methods, particularly at large noise levels.},

This paper expands upon this prior work by demonstrating how to exploit the structure of the relaxed optimization problem to design very fast solvers, capable of computing globally optimal trajectories with thousands of poses in a fraction of a second. In particular, we describe several computational enhancements for accelerating the underlying Riemannian trust-region optimization method, including the use of structure-exploiting matrix decomposition, iterative linear-algebraic techniques, truncated-Newton methods, and preconditioning strategies. We also describe methods for accelerating the minimum-eigenvalue computation used to certify the optimality of a recovered estimate. We have incorporated these computational enhancements in an updated version of the {SE}-Sync library, and released the corresponding code online. Experimental results indicate that this enhanced implementation of {SE}-Sync is approximately twice as fast as {GTSAM}, a highly optimized, state-of-the-art library for {SLAM}.},

	abstract = {Many estimation problems in robotics, computer vision, and learning require estimating unknown quantities in the face of outliers. Outliers are typically the result of incorrect data association or feature matching, and it is common to have problems where more than 90\% of the measurements used for estimation are outliers. While current approaches for robust estimation are able to deal with moderate amounts of outliers, they fail to produce accurate estimates in the presence of many outliers. This paper develops an approach to prune outliers. First, we develop a theory of invariance that allows us to quickly check if a subset of measurements are mutually compatible without explicitly solving the estimation problem. Second, we develop a graph-theoretic framework, where measurements are modeled as vertices and mutual compatibility is captured by edges. We generalize existing results showing that the inliers form a clique in this graph and typically belong to the maximum clique. We also show that in practice the maximum k-core of the compatibility graph provides an approximation of the maximum clique, while being faster to compute in large problems. These two contributions leads to {ROBIN}, our approach to Reject Outliers Based on {INvariants}, which allows us to quickly prune outliers in generic estimation problems. We demonstrate {ROBIN} in four geometric perception problems and show it boosts robustness of existing solvers while running in milliseconds in large problems.},

We relax this non-convex problem with its Shor’s relaxation, a convex program that can be solved by off-the-shelf tools. We follow the empirical observation that redundant but independent constraints tighten the relaxation. For that, we leverage equivalent deﬁnitions of the set of essential matrices based on the translation vectors between the cameras. Overconstrained characterizations of the set of essential matrices are derived by the combination of these deﬁnitions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, our proposal is empirically proved to remain tight and to require only 7 milliseconds to be solved even for the overconstrained formulations, ﬁnding the optimal solution under a wide variety of conﬁgurations, including highly noisy data and outliers. The solver cannot certify the solution only in very extreme cases, e.g. noise 100 pix and number of pair-wise correspondences under 15. The proposal is thus faster than other overconstrained formulations while being faster than the minimal ones, making it suitable for real-world applications that require optimality certiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {Estimating the orientations of nodes in a pose graph from relative angular measurements is challenging because the variables live on a manifold product with nontrivial topology and the maximum-likelihood objective function is non-convex and has multiple local minima; these issues prevent iterative solvers to be robust for large amounts of noise. This paper presents an approach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is based on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is equivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer vectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum likelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely unique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood solution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is “close” to the actual nodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem at hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates, for which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that the method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., σ = 30◦ on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors commonly used in mapping. For most range-ﬁnder-based scenarios, the multihypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the problem is very well constrained. Finally, using the orientations estimate provided by our method to bootstrap the initial guess of pose graph optimization methods improves their robustness and makes them avoid local minima even for high levels of noise.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) is an important tool that enables autonomous navigation of mobile robots through unknown environments. As the name {SLAM} suggests, it is important to obtain a correct representation of the environment and estimate a correct trajectory of the robot poses in the map. Dominant state-of-the-art approaches solve the pose estimation problem using graph optimization techniques based on the least squares minimization method. Among the most popular approaches are libraries such as g2o, Ceres, {GTSAM} and {SE}-Sync. The aim of this paper is to describe these approaches in a uniﬁed manner and to evaluate them on an array of publicly available synthetic and real-world pose graph datasets. In the evaluation experiments, the computation time and the value of the objective function of the four optimization libraries are analyzed.},

	abstract = {The rotation search problem aims to find a 3D rotation that best aligns a given number of point pairs. To induce robustness against outliers for rotation search, prior work considers truncated least-squares ({TLS}), which is a non-convex optimization problem, and its semidefinite relaxation ({SDR}) as a tractable alternative. Whether this {SDR} is theoretically tight in the presence of noise, outliers, or both has remained largely unexplored. We derive conditions that characterize the tightness of this {SDR}, showing that the tightness depends on the noise level, the truncation parameters of {TLS}, and the outlier distribution (random or clustered). In particular, we give a short proof for the tightness in the noiseless and outlier-free case, as opposed to the lengthy analysis of prior work.},

	title = {Estimation Contracts for Outlier-Robust Geometric Perception},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10521},
	abstract = {Outlier-robust estimation is a fundamental problem and has been extensively investigated by statisticians and practitioners. The last few years have seen a convergence across research fields towards "algorithmic robust statistics", which focuses on developing tractable outlier-robust techniques for high-dimensional estimation problems. Despite this convergence, research efforts across fields have been mostly disconnected from one another. This paper bridges recent work on certifiable outlier-robust estimation for geometric perception in robotics and computer vision with parallel work in robust statistics. In particular, we adapt and extend recent results on robust linear regressions (applicable to the low-outlier case with {\textless}{\textless} 50\% outliers) and list-decodable regression (applicable to the high-outlier case with {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 50\% outliers) to the setup commonly found in robotics and vision, where (i) variables (e.g., rotations, poses) belong to a non-convex domain, (ii) measurements are vector-valued, and (iii) the number of outliers is not known a priori. The emphasis here is on performance guarantees: rather than proposing new algorithms, we provide conditions on the input measurements under which modern estimation algorithms are guaranteed to recover an estimate close to the ground truth in the presence of outliers. These conditions are what we call an "estimation contract". Besides the proposed extensions of existing results, we believe the main contributions of this paper are (i) to unify parallel research lines by pointing out commonalities and differences, (ii) to introduce advanced material (e.g., sum-of-squares proofs) in an accessible and self-contained presentation for the practitioner, and (iii) to point out a few immediate opportunities and open questions in outlier-robust geometric perception.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear estimation in robotics and vision is typically plagued with outliers due to wrong data association or incorrect detections from signal processing and machine learning methods. This article introduces two unifying formulations for outlier-robust estimation, generalized maximum consensus (\${\textbackslash}{textG}\$-\${\textbackslash}{textMC}\$) and generalized truncated least squares (\${\textbackslash}{textG}-{TLS}\$), and investigates fundamental limits, practical algorithms, and applications. Our first contribution is a proof that outlier-robust estimation is inapproximable: In the worst case, it is impossible to (even approximately) find the set of outliers, even with slower-than-polynomial-time algorithms (particularly, algorithms running in quasi-polynomial time). As a second contribution, we review and extend two general-purpose algorithms. The first, adaptive trimming (\${\textbackslash}{textADAPT}\$), is combinatorial and is suitable for \${\textbackslash}{textG}\$-\${\textbackslash}{textMC}\$; the second, graduated nonconvexity (\${\textbackslash}{textGNC}\$), is based on homotopy methods and is suitable for \${\textbackslash}{textG}-{TLS}\$. We extend \${\textbackslash}{textADAPT}\$ and \${\textbackslash}{textGNC}\$ to the case where the user does not have prior knowledge of the inlier-noise statistics (or the statistics may vary over time) and is unable to guess a reasonable threshold to separate inliers from outliers (as the one commonly used in {RANdom} {SAmple} Consensus \$({\textbackslash}{textRANSAC})\$. We propose the first minimally tuned algorithms for outlier rejection, which dynamically decide how to separate inliers from outliers. Our third contribution is an evaluation of the proposed algorithms on robot perception problems: mesh registration, image-based object detection (shape alignment), and pose graph optimization. \${\textbackslash}{textADAPT}\$ and \${\textbackslash}{textGNC}\$ execute in real time, are deterministic, outperform \${\textbackslash}{textRANSAC}\$, and are robust up to 80–90\% outliers. Their minimally tuned versions also compare favorably with the state of the art, even though they do not rely on a noise bound for the inliers.},

This work proposes the ﬁrst polynomial-time certiﬁably optimal approach for solving the Wahba problem when a large number of vector observations are outliers. Our ﬁrst contribution is to formulate the Wahba problem using a Truncated Least Squares ({TLS}) cost that is insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. The second contribution is to rewrite the problem using unit quaternions and show that the {TLS} cost can be framed as a Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program ({QCQP}). Since the resulting optimization is still highly non-convex and hard to solve globally, our third contribution is to develop a convex Semideﬁnite Programming ({SDP}) relaxation. We show that while a naive relaxation performs poorly in general, our relaxation is tight even in the presence of large noise and outliers. We validate the proposed algorithm, named {QUASAR} ({QUAternion}-based Semideﬁnite {relAxation} for Robust alignment), in both synthetic and real datasets showing that the algorithm outperforms {RANSAC}, robust local optimization techniques, global outlier-removal procedures, and Branch-and-Bound methods. {QUASAR} is able to compute certiﬁably optimal solutions (i.e. the relaxation is exact) even in the case when 95\% of the correspondences are outliers.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794454},
	abstract = {Autonomous navigation requires an accurate model or map of the environment. While dramatic progress in the prior two decades has enabled large-scale simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}), the majority of existing methods rely on non-linear optimization techniques to find the maximum likelihood estimate ({MLE}) of the robot trajectory and surrounding environment. These methods are prone to local minima and are thus sensitive to initialization. Several recent papers have developed optimization algorithms for the Pose-Graph {SLAM} problem that can certify the optimality of a computed solution. Though this does not guarantee a priori that this approach generates an optimal solution, a recent extension has shown that when the noise lies within a critical threshold that the solution to the optimization algorithm is guaranteed to be optimal. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper illustrates that the Pose-Graph {SLAM} and Landmark {SLAM} can be formulated as polynomial optimization programs that are sum-of-squares ({SOS}) convex. This paper then describes how the Pose-Graph and Landmark {SLAM} problems can be solved to a global minimum without initialization regardless of noise level using the sparse bounded degree sum-of-squares (Sparse-{BSOS}) optimization method. Finally, the superior performance of the proposed approach when compared to existing {SLAM} methods is illustrated on graphs with several hundred nodes.},

	abstract = {In the state-of-the-art approaches to {SLAM}, the problem is often formulated as a non-linear least squares. {SLAM} back-ends often employ iterative methods such as Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt to solve that problem. In general, there is no guarantee on the global convergence of these methods. The back-end might get trapped into a local minimum or even diverge depending on how good the initial estimate is. Due to the large noise in odometry data, it is not wise to rely on dead reckoning for obtaining an initial guess, especially in long trajectories. In this paper we demonstrate how M-estimation can be used as a bootstrapping technique to obtain a reliable initial guess. We show that this initial guess is more likely to be in the basin of attraction of the global minimum than existing bootstrapping methods. As the main contribution of this paper, we present new insights about the similarities between robustness against outliers and robustness against a bad initial guess. Through simulations and experiments on real data, we substantiate the reliability of our proposed method.},

The {QCQP} formulation can then be relaxed into a semi-definite programming ({SDP}) problem which is convex. Unique solution to the convex {SDP} problem can be obtained without initial state estimate and can be used to construct a candidate solution to the original {LS} pose {SLAM} problem. Simulation datasets and the Intel Research Lab dataset have been used to demonstrate that when the relative pose information contain noises with reasonable level, the candidate solution obtained through the relaxation is very close to the optimal solution to the {LS} {SLAM} problem. Thus in practice, the candidate solution can serve as either an approximate solution or a good initial guess for a local optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal solution to the {LS} pose {SLAM} problem.},

	abstract = {Convex (specifically semidefinite) relaxation provides a powerful approach to constructing robust machine perception systems, enabling the recovery of certifiably globally optimal solutions of challenging estimation problems in many practical settings. However, solving the large-scale semidefinite relaxations underpinning this approach remains a formidable computational challenge. A dominant cost in many state-of-the-art (Burer-Monteiro factorization-based) certifiable estimation methods is solution verification (testing the global optimality of a given candidate solution), which entails computing a minimum eigenpair of a certain symmetric certificate matrix. In this letter, we show how to significantly accelerate this verification step, and thereby the overall speed of certifiable estimation methods. First, we show that the certificate matrices arising in the Burer-Monteiro approach generically possess spectra that make the verification problem expensive to solve using standard iterative eigenvalue methods. We then show how to address this challenge using preconditioned eigensolvers; specifically, we design a specialized solution verification algorithm based upon the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient ({LOBPCG}) method together with a simple yet highly effective algebraic preconditioner. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world examples shows that our proposed verification scheme is very effective in practice, accelerating solution verification by up to 280x, and the overall Burer-Monteiro method by up to 16x, versus the standard Lanczos method when applied to relaxations derived from large-scale {SLAM} benchmarks.},

Locating a device from distance measurements is typically posed as a non-convex optimization problem, stemming from the nonlinearity of the measurement model. Non-convex optimization problems may yield suboptimal solutions when local iterative solvers such as Gauss-Newton are employed. In this letter, we design an optimality certificate for continuous-time range-only localization. Our formulation allows for the integration of a motion prior, which ensures smoothness of the solution and is crucial for localizing from only a few distance measurements. The proposed certificate comes at little additional cost since it has the same complexity as the sparse local solver itself: linear in the number of positions. We show, both in simulation and on real-world datasets, that the efficient local solver often finds the globally optimal solution (confirmed by our certificate), but it may converge to local solutions with high errors, which our certificate correctly detects.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9811788},
	abstract = {In this work we present the first initialization methods equipped with explicit performance guarantees that are adapted to the pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) and rotation averaging ({RA}) problems. {SLAM} and rotation averaging are typically formalized as large-scale nonconvex point estimation problems, with many bad local minima that can entrap the smooth optimization methods typically applied to solve them; the performance of standard {SLAM} and {RA} algorithms thus crucially depends upon the quality of the estimates used to initialize this local search. While many initialization methods for {SLAM} and {RA} have appeared in the literature, these are typically obtained as purely heuristic approximations, making it difficult to determine whether (or under what circumstances) these techniques can be reliably deployed. In contrast, in this work we study the problem of initialization through the lens of spectral relaxation. Specifically, we derive a simple spectral relaxation of {SLAM} and {RA}, the form of which enables us to exploit classical linear-algebraic techniques (eigenvector perturbation bounds) to control the distance from our spectral estimate to both the (unknown) ground-truth and the global minimizer of the estimation prob lem as a function of measurement noise. Our results reveal the critical role that spectral graph-theoretic properties of the measurement network play in controlling estimation accuracy; moreover, as a by-product of our analysis we obtain new bounds on the estimation error for the maximum likelihood estimators in {SLAM} and {RA}, which are likely to be of independent interest. Finally, we show experimentally that our spectral estimator is very effective in practice, producing initializations of comparable or superior quality at lower computational cost compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

	doi = {10.1109/LRA.2023.3238173},
	abstract = {Modern state estimation is often formulated as an optimization problem and solved using efficient local search methods. These methods at best guarantee convergence to local minima, but, in some cases, global optimality can also be certified. Although such global optimality certificates have been well established for 3D pose-graph optimization, the details have yet to be worked out for the 3D landmark-based {SLAM} problem, in which estimated states include both robot poses and map landmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by using a graph-theoretic approach to cast the subproblems of landmark-based {SLAM} into a form that yields a sufficient condition for global optimality. Efficient methods of computing the optimality certificates for these subproblems exist, but first require the construction of a large data matrix. We show that this matrix can be constructed with complexity that remains linear in the number of landmarks and does not exceed the state-of-the-art computational complexity of one local solver iteration. We demonstrate the efficacy of the certificate on simulated and real-world landmark-based {SLAM} problems. We also integrate our method into the state-of-the-art {SE}-Sync pipeline to efficiently solve landmark-based {SLAM} problems to global optimality. Finally, we study the robustness of the global optimality certificate to measurement noise, taking into consideration the effect of the underlying measurement graph.},

	abstract = {Why is it that semideﬁnite relaxations have been so successful in numerous applications in computer vision and robotics for solving non-convex optimization problems involving rotations? In studying the empirical performance, we note that there are few failure cases reported in the literature, in particular for estimation problems with a single rotation, motivating us to gain further theoretical understanding. A general framework based on tools from algebraic geometry is introduced for analyzing the power of semideﬁnite relaxations of problems with quadratic objective functions and rotational constraints. Applications include registration, hand–eye calibration, and rotation averaging. We characterize the extreme points and show that there exist failure cases for which the relaxation is not tight, even in the case of a single rotation. We also show that some problem classes are always tight given an appropriate parametrization. Our theoretical ﬁndings are accompanied with numerical simulations, providing further evidence and understanding of the results.},
