We propose an algorithm to extract candidate solutions to this problem from its semidefinite programming relaxations. We then describe a sufficient condition and a polynomial time test for certifying when such a solution is optimal. This test has no false positives. Experiments indicate that false negatives are rare, and the algorithm has excellent performance in practice. We explain this phenomenon in terms of the geometry of the triangulation problem.},

  abstract = {Maximum likelihood estimation problems are, in general, intractable optimization problems. As a result, it is common to approximate the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) using convex relaxations. In some cases, the relaxation is tight: it recovers the true MLE. Most tightness proofs only apply to situations where the MLE exactly recovers a planted solution (known to the analyst). It is then sufficient to establish that the optimality conditions hold at the planted signal. In this paper, we study an estimation problem (angular synchronization) for which the MLE is not a simple function of the planted solution, yet for which the convex relaxation is tight. To establish tightness in this context, the proof is less direct because the point at which to verify optimality conditions is not known explicitly. Angular synchronization consists in estimating a collection of n phases, given noisy measurements of the pairwise relative phases. The MLE for angular synchronization is the solution of a (hard) non-bipartite Grothendieck problem over the complex numbers. We consider a stochastic model for the data: a planted signal (that is, a ground truth set of phases) is corrupted with non-adversarial random noise. Even though the MLE does not coincide with the planted signal, we show that the classical semidefinite relaxation for it is tight, with high probability. This holds even for high levels of noise.},

Some such relaxations exist in the literature for specific problem setups that assume the matrix von Mises-Fisher distribution (a.k.a., matrix Langevin distribution or chordal distance) for isotropic rotational uncertainty. However, another common way to represent uncertainty for rotations and poses is to define anisotropic noise in the associated Lie algebra. Starting from a noise model based on the Cayley map, we define our estimation problems, convert them to Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (QCQPs), then relax them to Semidefinite Programs (SDPs), which can be solved using standard interior-point optimization methods. We first show how to carry out basic rotation and pose averaging. We then turn to the more complex problem of trajectory estimation, which involves many pose variables with both individual and inter-pose measurements (or motion priors). Our contribution is to formulate SDP relaxations for all these problems, including the identification of sufficient redundant constraints to make them tight. We hope our results can add to the catalogue of useful estimation problems whose global optimality can be guaranteed.},

In some situations, a vectorial parameterization of pose can be useful, where elements of a vector space are surjectively mapped to a matrix Lie group. For example, these vectorial representations can be employed for optimization as well as uncertainty representation on groups. The most common mapping is the matrix exponential, which maps elements of a Lie algebra onto the associated Lie group. However, this choice is not unique. It has been previously shown how to characterize all such vectorial parameterizations for SO(3), the group of rotations. Some results are also known for the group of poses, where it is possible to build a family of vectorial mappings that includes the matrix exponential as well as the Cayley transformation. We extend what is known for these pose mappings to the 4 x 4 representation common in robotics, and also demonstrate three different examples of the proposed pose mappings: (i) pose interpolation, (ii) pose servoing control, and (iii) pose estimation in a pointcloud alignment problem. In the pointcloud alignment problem our results lead to a new algorithm based on the Cayley transformation, which we call CayPer.},

Following the Burer-Monteiro approach, we optimize a factor Y of size n {\texttimes} p instead, such that X = YYT. This ensures positive semidefiniteness at no cost and can reduce the dimension of the problem if p is small, but results in a nonconvex optimization problem with a quadratic cost function and quadratic equality constraints in Y. In this paper, we show that if the set of constraints on Y regularly defines a smooth manifold, then, despite nonconvexity, first- and second-order necessary optimality conditions are also sufficient, provided p is large enough. For smaller values of p, we show a similar result holds for almost all (linear) cost functions. Under those conditions, a global optimum Y maps to a global optimum X = YYT of the SDP. We deduce old and new consequences for SDP relaxations of the generalized eigenvector problem, the trust-region subproblem, and quadratic optimization over several spheres, as well as for the Max-Cut and Orthogonal-Cut SDPs, which are common relaxations in stochastic block modeling and synchronization of rotations.},

To address this shortcoming, over a decade ago, Burer and Monteiro proposed to solve SDP's with few equality constraints via rank-restricted, non-convex surrogates. Remarkably, for some applications, local optimization methods seem to converge to global optima of these non-convex surrogates reliably. Although some theory supports this empirical success, a complete explanation of it remains an open question. In this paper, we consider a class of SDP's which includes applications such as max-cut, community detection in the stochastic block model, robust PCA, phase retrieval and synchronization of rotations. We show that the low-rank Burer--Monteiro formulation of SDP's in that class almost never has any spurious local optima.},

First, we provide a novel, elegant, and compact matrix formulation of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for this problem, drawing interesting connections with the connection Laplacian of a graph object. Second, even though the MLE problem is nonconvex and computationally intractable in general, we exploit recent advances in convex relaxations of PGO and Riemannian techniques for low-rank optimization to yield an a posteriori certifiably globally optimal algorithm [A. Bandeira, ``A note on probably certifiably correct algorithms,'' Comptes Rendus Mathematique , vol. 354, pp. 329-333, 2016.] that is also fast and scalable. This work builds upon a fairly demanding mathematical machinery, but beyond the theoretical basis presented, we demonstrate its performance through extensive experimentation in common large-scale SLAM datasets. The proposed framework, Cartan-Sync, is up to one order of magnitude faster that the state-of-the-art SE-Sync [D. M. Rosen et al. ``A certifiably correct algorithm for synchronization over the special Euclidean group,'' in Proc. Int. Workshop Algorithmic Found.

In studying the empirical performance, we note that there are few failure cases reported in the literature, in particular for estimation problems with a single rotation, motivating us to gain further theoretical understanding. A general framework based on tools from algebraic geometry is introduced for analyzing the power of semidefinite relaxations of problems with quadratic objective functions and rotational constraints. Applications include registration, hand--eye calibration, and rotation averaging. We characterize the extreme points and show that there exist failure cases for which the relaxation is not tight, even in the case of a single rotation. We also show that some problem classes are always tight given an appropriate parametrization. Our theoretical findings are accompanied with numerical simulations, providing further evidence and understanding of the results.},

PGO is a nonconvex problem, and currently no known technique can guarantee the computation of an optimal solution. In this paper, we show that Lagrangian duality allows computing a globally optimal solution, under certain conditions that are satisfied in many practical cases. Our first contribution is to frame the PGO problem in the complex domain. This makes analysis easier and allows drawing connections with the recent literature on unit gain graphs. Exploiting this connection we prove non-trival results about the spectrum of the matrix underlying the problem. The second contribution is to formulate and analyze the dual problem in the complex domain. Our analysis shows that the duality gap is connected to the number of eigenvalues of the penalized pose graph matrix, which arises from the solution of the dual. We prove that if this matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, then (i) the duality gap is zero, (ii) the primal PGO problem has a unique solution, and (iii) the primal solution can be computed by scaling an eigenvector of the penalized pose graph matrix. The third contribution is algorithmic: we exploit the dual problem and propose an algorithm that computes a guaranteed optimal solution for PGO when the penalized pose graph matrix satisfies the Single Zero Eigenvalue Property (SZEP). We also propose a variant that deals with the case in which the SZEP is not satisfied. The fourth contribution is a numerical analysis. Empirical evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases (100\% of the tests under noise regimes of practical robotics applications) the penalized pose graph matrix does satisfy the SZEP, hence our approach allows computing the global optimal solution. Finally, we report simple counterexamples in which the duality gap is nonzero, and discuss open problems.},

  abstract = {Estimating the orientations of nodes in a pose graph from relative angular measurements is challenging because the variables live on a manifold product with nontrivial topology and the maximum-likelihood objective function is non-convex and has multiple local minima; these issues prevent iterative solvers to be robust for large amounts of noise. This paper presents an approach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is based on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is equivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer vectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum likelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely unique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood solution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is ``close'' to the actual nodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem at hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates, for which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that the method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., {$\sigma$} = 30{\textopenbullet} on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors commonly used in mapping. For most range-finder-based scenarios, the multihypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the problem is very well constrained. Finally, using the orientations estimate provided by our method to bootstrap the initial guess of pose graph optimization methods improves their robustness and makes them avoid local minima even for high levels of noise.},

Local convergence usually implies artifacts in map reconstruction and large localization errors, hence it is very undesirable for applications in which accuracy and safety are of paramount importance. We provide a technique to verify if a given 2D SLAM solution is globally optimal. The insight is that, while computing the optimal solution is hard in general, duality theory provides tools to compute tight bounds on the optimal cost, via convex programming. These bounds can be used to evaluate the quality of a SLAM solution, hence providing a ``sanity check'' for stateof-the-art incremental and batch solvers. Experimental results show that our technique successfully identifies wrong estimates (i.e., local minima) in large-scale SLAM scenarios. This work, together with [1], represents a step towards the objective of having SLAM techniques with guaranteed performance, that can be used in safety-critical applications.},

While these techniques often work well in practice, they do not provide guarantees on the quality of the estimate. This paper shows that Lagrangian duality is a powerful tool to assess the quality of a given candidate solution. Our contribution is threefold. First, we discuss a revised formulation of the SLAM inference problem. We show that this formulation is probabilistically grounded and has the advantage of leading to an optimization problem with quadratic objective. The second contribution is the derivation of the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem. The SLAM dual problem is a (convex) semidefinite program, which can be solved reliably and globally by off-the-shelf solvers. The third contribution is to discuss the relation between the original SLAM problem and its dual. We show that from the dual problem, one can evaluate the quality (i.e., the suboptimality gap) of a candidate SLAM solution, and ultimately provide a certificate of optimality. Moreover, when the duality gap is zero, one can compute a guaranteed optimal SLAM solution from the dual problem, circumventing non-convex optimization. We present extensive (real and simulated) experiments supporting our claims and discuss practical relevance and open problems.},

This paper shows that the FIM for pose tracking can be bounded by a function of the FIM for localization on a known map, thereby reducing the analysis to a finite-dimensional problem. The resulting bounds are independent of the map prior and representation. The results are valid for any relative sensor; the experimental verification is done for the particular case of pose tracking using range-finders (scan matching).},

For each point, we are given (possibly noisy) measurements of its local coordinates in some of the coordinate systems. Alternatively, for each coordinate system, we observe the coordinates of a subset of the points. The problem of estimating the global coordinates of the N points (up to a rigid transform) from such measurements comes up in distributed approaches to molecular conformation and sensor network localization, and also in computer vision and graphics. The least-squares formulation of this problem, although nonconvex, has a well-known closed-form solution when M = 2 (based on the singular value decomposition (SVD)). However, no closed-form solution is known for M {$\geq$} 3. In this paper, we demonstrate how the least-squares formulation can be relaxed into a convex program, namely, a semidefinite program (SDP). By setting up connections between the uniqueness of this SDP and results from rigidity theory, we prove conditions for exact and stable recovery for the SDP relaxation. In particular, we prove that the SDP relaxation can guarantee recovery under more adversarial conditions compared to earlier proposed spectral relaxations, and we derive error bounds for the registration error incurred by the SDP relaxation. We also present results of numerical experiments on simulated data to confirm the theoretical findings. We empirically demonstrate that (a) unlike the spectral relaxation, the relaxation gap is mostly zero for the SDP (i.e., we are able to solve the original nonconvex least-squares problem) up to a certain noise threshold, and (b) the SDP performs significantly better than spectral and manifold-optimization methods, particularly at large noise levels.},

However, long-term visual localization is still a challenge due to the environmental appearance changes caused by lighting and seasons. While techniques exist to address appearance changes using neural networks, these methods typically require ground-truth pose information to generate accurate image correspondences or act as a supervisory signal during training. In this paper, we present a novel self-supervised feature learning framework for metric visual localization. We use a sequence-based image matching algorithm across different sequences of images (i.e., experiences) to generate image correspondences without ground-truth labels. We can then sample image pairs to train a deep neural network that learns sparse features with associated descriptors and scores without ground-truth pose supervision. The learned features can be used together with a classical pose estimator for visual stereo localization. We validate the learned features by integrating with an existing Visual Teach \& Repeat pipeline to perform closed-loop localization experiments under different lighting conditions for a total of 22.4 km.},

SLAM and rotation averaging are typically formalized as large-scale nonconvex point estimation problems, with many bad local minima that can entrap the smooth optimization methods typically applied to solve them; the performance of standard SLAM and RA algorithms thus crucially depends upon the quality of the estimates used to initialize this local search. While many initialization methods for SLAM and RA have appeared in the literature, these are typically obtained as purely heuristic approximations, making it difficult to determine whether (or under what circumstances) these techniques can be reliably deployed. In contrast, in this work we study the problem of initialization through the lens of spectral relaxation. Specifically, we derive a simple spectral relaxation of SLAM and RA, the form of which enables us to exploit classical linear-algebraic techniques (eigenvector perturbation bounds) to control the distance from our spectral estimate to both the (unknown) ground-truth and the global minimizer of the estimation problem as a function of measurement noise. Our results reveal the critical role that spectral graph-theoretic properties of the measurement network play in controlling estimation accuracy; moreover, as a by-product of our analysis we obtain new bounds on the estimation error for the maximum likelihood estimators in SLAM and RA, which are likely to be of independent interest. Finally, we show experimentally that our spectral estimator is very effective in practice, producing initializations of comparable or superior quality at lower computational cost compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

In graph-based SLAM, the number of edges (measurements) in a pose graph determines both the memory requirements of storing a robot's observations and the computational expense of algorithms deployed for performing state estimation using those observations; both of which can grow unbounded during long-term navigation. To address this, we propose a spectral approach for pose graph sparsification which maximizes the algebraic connectivity of the sparsified measurement graphs, a key quantity which has been shown to control the estimation error of pose graph SLAM solutions. Our algorithm, MAC (for "maximizing algebraic connectivity"), which is based on convex relaxation, is simple and computationally inexpensive, and admits formal post hoc performance guarantees on the quality of the solutions it provides. In experiments on benchmark pose-graph SLAM datasets, we show that our approach quickly produces high-quality sparsification results which retain the connectivity of the graph and, in turn, the quality of corresponding SLAM solutions, as compared to a baseline approach which does not consider graph connectivity.},

  abstract = {In recent years, semidefinite relaxations of common optimization problems in robotics have attracted growing attention due to their ability to provide globally optimal solutions. In many cases, specific handcrafted redundant constraints are added to the relaxation in order to improve its tightness, which is usually a requirement for obtaining or certifying globally optimal solutions. These constraints are formulation-dependent and typically require a lengthy manual process to find. Instead, the present paper suggests an automatic method to find a set of sufficient redundant constraints to obtain tightness, if they exist. We first propose an efficient feasibility check to determine if a given set of variables can lead to a tight formulation. Secondly, we show how to scale the method to problems of bigger size. At no point of the entire process do we have to manually find redundant constraints. We showcase the effectiveness of the approach by providing new insights on two classical robotics problems: range-based localization and stereo-based pose estimation. Finally, we reproduce semidefinite relaxations presented in recent literature and show that our automatic method finds a smaller set of constraints sufficient for tightness than previously considered.},

Locating a device from distance measurements is typically posed as a non-convex optimization problem, stemming from the nonlinearity of the measurement model. Non-convex optimization problems may yield suboptimal solutions when local iterative solvers such as Gauss-Newton are employed. In this letter, we design an optimality certificate for continuous-time range-only localization. Our formulation allows for the integration of a motion prior, which ensures smoothness of the solution and is crucial for localizing from only a few distance measurements. The proposed certificate comes at little additional cost since it has the same complexity as the sparse local solver itself: linear in the number of positions. We show, both in simulation and on real-world datasets, that the efficient local solver often finds the globally optimal solution (confirmed by our certificate), but it may converge to local solutions with high errors, which our certificate correctly detects.},

Common scalable methods for approximating solutions of these NP-hard problems are the spectral relaxation for non-convex energies and the doubly stochastic (DS) relaxation for convex energies. Lately, it has been demonstrated that semidefinite programming relaxations can have considerably improved accuracy at the price of a much higher computational cost. We present a convex quadratic programming relaxation which is provably stronger than both DS and spectral relaxations, with the same scalability as the DS relaxation. The derivation of the relaxation also naturally suggests a projection method for achieving meaningful integer solutions which improves upon the standard closest-permutation projection. Our method can be easily extended to optimization over doubly stochastic matrices, injective matching, and problems with additional linear constraints. We employ recent advances in optimization of linear-assignment type problems to achieve an efficient algorithm for solving the convex relaxation. We present experiments indicating that our method is more accurate than local minimization or competing relaxations for non-convex problems. We successfully apply our algorithm to shape matching and to the problem of ordering images in a grid, obtaining results which compare favorably with state of the art methods. We believe our results indicate that our method should be considered the method of choice for quadratic optimization over permutations.},

In its conventional form, rotation averaging is stated as a minimization over multiple rotation constraints. As these constraints are non-convex, this problem is generally considered challenging to solve globally. We show how to circumvent this difficulty through the use of Lagrangian duality. While such an approach is well-known it is normally not guaranteed to provide a tight relaxation. Based on spectral graph theory, we analytically prove that in many cases there is no duality gap unless the noise levels are severe. This allows us to obtain certifiably global solutions to a class of important non-convex problems in polynomial time.},

In this paper, we use a method that implicitly defines a constrained prior such that the posterior assigns positive probability to the boundary of the constraint set. We show that by projecting posterior mass onto the constraint set, we obtain a new posterior with a rich probabilistic structure on the boundary of that set. If the original posterior is a Gaussian, then such a projection can be done efficiently. We apply the method to Bayesian linear inverse problems, in which case samples can be obtained by repeatedly solving constrained least squares problems, similar to a MAP estimate, but with perturbations in the data. When combined into a Bayesian hierarchical model and the constraint set is a polyhedral cone, we can derive a Gibbs sampler to efficiently sample from the hierarchical model. To show the effect of projecting the posterior, we applied the method to deblurring and computed tomography examples.},

We present complex (CPL)-SLAM, an efficient and certifiably correct algorithm to solve planar graph-based SLAM using the complex number representation. We formulate and simplify planar graph-based SLAM as the maximum likelihood estimation on the product of unit complex numbers, and relax this nonconvex quadratic complex optimization problem to convex complex semidefinite programming (SDP). Furthermore, we simplify the corresponding complex SDP to Riemannian staircase optimization (RSO) on the complex oblique manifold that can be solved with the Riemannian trust region method. In addition, we prove that the SDP relaxation and RSO simplification are tight as long as the noise magnitude is below a certain threshold. The efficacy of this work is validated through applications of CPL-SLAM and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods on planar graph-based SLAM, which indicates that our proposed algorithm is capable of solving planar graph-based SLAM certifiably, and is more efficient in numerical computation and more robust to measurement noise than existing state-of-the-art methods.

We follow the empirical observation that redundant but independent constraints tighten the relaxation. For that, we leverage equivalent definitions of the set of essential matrices based on the translation vectors between the cameras. Overconstrained characterizations of the set of essential matrices are derived by the combination of these definitions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, our proposal is empirically proved to remain tight and to require only 7 milliseconds to be solved even for the overconstrained formulations, finding the optimal solution under a wide variety of configurations, including highly noisy data and outliers. The solver cannot certify the solution only in very extreme cases, e.g. noise 100 pix and number of pair-wise correspondences under 15. The proposal is thus faster than other overconstrained formulations while being faster than the minimal ones, making it suitable for real-world applications that require optimality certification.},

For robots with redundant degrees of freedom, there is often an infinite, nonconvex set of solutions. The IK problem is further complicated when collision avoidance constraints are imposed by obstacles in the workspace. In general, closed-form expressions yielding feasible configurations do not exist, motivating the use of numerical solution methods. However, these approaches rely on local optimization of nonconvex problems, often requiring an accurate initialization or numerous re-initializations to converge to a valid solution. In this work, we first formulate inverse kinematics with complex workspace constraints as a convex feasibility problem whose low-rank feasible points provide exact IK solutions. We then present CIDGIK (Convex Iteration for Distance-Geometric Inverse Kinematics), an algorithm that solves this feasibility problem with a sequence of semidefinite programs whose objectives are designed to encourage low-rank minimizers. Our problem formulation elegantly unifies the configuration space and workspace constraints of a robot: intrinsic robot geometry and obstacle avoidance are both expressed as simple linear matrix equations and inequalities. Our experimental results for a variety of popular manipulator models demonstrate faster and more accurate convergence than a conventional nonlinear optimization-based approach, especially in environments with many obstacles.},

In the absence of a good initial guess, commonly used iterative solvers can get stuck in these local minima resulting in poor trajectory estimation accuracy. In this letter, we propose convex relaxations to the original non-convex problem based on semidefinite programs (SDPs). Specifically, we formulate computationally tractable SDP relaxations to obtain accurate initial pose and trajectory estimates for RO trajectory estimation under static and dynamic (i.e., constant-velocity motion) conditions. Through simulation and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed approaches estimate the initial pose and initial trajectories accurately compared to iterative local solvers.

These methods at best guarantee convergence to local minima, but, in some cases, global optimality can also be certified. Although such global optimality certificates have been well established for 3D pose-graph optimization, the details have yet to be worked out for the 3D landmark-based SLAM problem, in which estimated states include both robot poses and map landmarks. In this letter, we address this gap by using a graph-theoretic approach to cast the subproblems of landmark-based SLAM into a form that yields a sufficient condition for global optimality. Efficient methods of computing the optimality certificates for these subproblems exist, but first require the construction of a large data matrix. We show that this matrix can be constructed with complexity that remains linear in the number of landmarks and does not exceed the stateof-the-art computational complexity of one local solver iteration. We demonstrate the efficacy of the certificate on simulated and real-world landmark-based SLAM problems. We also integrate our method into the state-of-the-art SE-Sync pipeline to efficiently solve landmark-based SLAM problems to global optimality. Finally, we study the robustness of the global optimality certificate to measurement noise, taking into consideration the effect of the underlying measurement graph.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the development of so-called certifiable perception methods, which leverage semidefinite, convex relaxations to find global optima of perception problems in robotics. However, many of these relaxations rely on simplifying assumptions that facilitate the problem formulation, such as an isotropic measurement noise distribution. In this paper, we explore the tightness of the semidefinite relaxations of matrix-weighted (anisotropic) state-estimation problems and reveal the limitations lurking therein: matrix-weighted factors can cause convex relaxations to lose tightness. In particular, we show that the semidefinite relaxations of localization problems with matrix weights may be tight only for low noise levels. We empirically explore the factors that contribute to this loss of tightness and demonstrate that redundant constraints can be used to regain tightness, albeit at the expense of real-time performance. As a second technical contribution of this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art relaxation of scalar-weighted SLAM cannot be used when matrix weights are considered. We provide an alternate formulation and show that its SDP relaxation is not tight (even for very low noise levels) unless specific redundant constraints are used. We demonstrate the tightness of our formulations on both simulated and real-world data.},

  abstract = {Markov random fields (MRFs) are a popular model for several pattern recognition and reconstruction problems in robotics and computer vision. Inference in MRFs is intractable in general and related work resorts to approximation algorithms. Among those techniques, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been shown to provide accurate estimates, while scaling poorly with the problem size and being typically slow for practical applications. Our first contribution is to design a dual ascent method to solve standard SDP relaxations that takes advantage of the geometric structure of the problem to speed up computation. This technique, named dual ascent Riemannian staircase (DARS), is able to solve large problem instances in seconds. Our second contribution is to develop a second and faster approach. The backbone of this second approach is a novel SDP relaxation combined with a fast and scalable solver based on smooth Riemannian optimization. We show that this approach, named Fast Unconstrained SEmidefinite Solver (FUSES), can solve large problems in milliseconds. Contrarily to local MRF solvers, e.g., loopy belief propagation, our approaches do not require an initial guess. Moreover, we leverage recent results from optimization theory to provide per-instance sub-optimality guarantees. We demonstrate the proposed approaches in multi-class image segmentation problems. Extensive experimental evidence shows that: 1) FUSES and DARS produce near-optimal solutions, attaining an objective within 0.1\% of the optimum; 2) FUSES and DARS are remarkably faster than general-purpose SDP solvers, and FUSES is more than two orders of magnitude faster than DARS while attaining similar solution quality; and 3) FUSES is faster than local search methods while being a global solver.},

Similar to a clique tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored probability density, but unlike the clique tree it is directed and maps more naturally to the square root information matrix of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better understanding of the matrix factorization in terms of probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, named iSAM2, which achieves improvements in efficiency through incremental variable re-ordering and fluid relinearization, eliminating the need for periodic batch steps. We analyze various properties of iSAM2 in detail, and show on a range of real and simulated datasets that our algorithm compares favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and efficiency.},

Our approach is based on a hierarchy of convex relaxations to solve nonconvex optimization problems with polynomials. These convex relaxations generate a monotone sequence of lower bounds and we show how one can detect whether the global optimum is attained at a given relaxation. The technique is applied to a number of classical vision problems: triangulation, camera pose, homography estimation and last, but not least, epipolar geometry estimation. Experimental validation on both synthetic and real data is provided. In practice, only a few relaxations are needed for attaining the global optimum},

Separability is an overlooked structure of SLAM that distinguishes it from a generic nonlinear least-squares problem. The standard relative-pose and relative-position measurement models in SLAM are affine with respect to robot and features' positions. Therefore, given an estimate for robot orientation, the conditionally optimal estimate for the rest of the state variables can be easily computed by solving a sparse linear least-squares problem. We propose an algorithm to exploit this intrinsic property of SLAM by stripping the problem down to its nonlinear core, while maintaining its natural sparsity. Our algorithm can be used in conjunction with any Newton-based solver and is applicable to 2-D/3-D pose-graph and feature-based SLAM. Our results suggest that iteratively solving the nonlinear core of SLAM leads to a fast and reliable convergence as compared to the state-of-the-art sparse back-ends.},

  abstract = {Sensing 3-D shape and motion is an important problem in autonomous navigation and manipulation. Stereo vision is an attractive approach to this problem in several domains. In this thesis, I address fundamental components of this problem by using stereo vision to estimate the 3-D structure of "depth" of objects visible to a robot, as well as to estimate the motion of the robot as its travels through an unknown environment. I begin by using cameras on-board a robot vehicle to estimate the motion of the vehicle by tracking 3-D feature-points or "landmarks". I formulate this task as a statistical estimation problem, develop sequential methods for estimating the vehicle motion and updating the landmark model, and implement a system that successfully tracks landmarks through stereo image sequences. In laboratory experiments, this system has achieved an accuracy of 2\${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}\$\% of distance over 5.5 meters and 55 stereo image pairs. These results establish the importance of statistical modelling in this problem and demonstrate the feasibility of visual motion estimation in unknown environments. This work embodies a successful paradigm for feature-based depth and motion estimation, but the feature-based approach results in a very limited 3-D model of the environment. To extend this aspect of the system, I address the problem of estimating "depth maps" from stereo images. Depth maps specify scene depth for each pixel in the image. I propose a system architecture in which exploratory camera motion is used to acquire a narrow-baseline image pair by moving one camera of the stereo system. Depth estimates obtained from this image pair are used to "bootstrap" matching of a wide-baseline image pair acquired with both cameras of the system. I formulate the bootstrap operation statistically by modelling depth maps as random fields and developing Bayesian matching algorithms in which depth information from the narrow-baseline image pair determines the prior density for matching the wide baseline image pair. This leads to efficient, area-based matching algorithms that are applied independently for each pixel or each scanline of the image. Experimental results with images of complex, outdoor scene models demonstrate the power of the approach.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of solving different pose and registration problems under rotational constraints. Traditionally, methods such as the iterative closest point algorithm have been used to solve these problems. They may however get stuck in local minima due to the non-convexity of the problem. In recent years methods for finding the global optimum, based on Branch and Bound and convex under-estimators, have been developed. These methods are provably optimal, however since they are based on global optimization methods they are in general more time consuming than local methods. In this paper we adopt a dual approach. Rather than trying to find the globally optimal solution we investigate the quality of the solutions obtained using Lagrange duality. Our approach allows us to formulate a single convex semidefinite program that approximates the original problem well.},

  abstract = {We present the first algorithm capable of efficiently computing certifiably optimal solutions to range-aided simultaneous localization and mapping (RA-SLAM) problems. Robotic navigation systems are increasingly incorporating point-to-point ranging sensors, leading state estimation which takes the form of RA-SLAM. However, the RA-SLAM problem is more difficult to solve than traditional pose-graph SLAM; ranging sensor models introduce additional non-convexity, unlike pose-pose or pose-landmark measurements, a single range measurement does not uniquely determine the relative transform between the involved sensors, and RA-SLAM inference is highly sensitive to initial estimates. Our approach relaxes the RA-SLAM problem to a semidefinite program (SDP), which we show how to solve efficiently using the Riemannian staircase methodology. The solution of this SDP provides a high-quality initialization for our original RA-SLAM problem, which is subsequently refined via local optimization, as well as a lower-bound on the RA-SLAM problem's optimal value. Our algorithm, named certifiably correct RA-SLAM (CORA), applies to problems comprised of arbitrary pose-pose, pose-landmark, and ranging measurements. Evaluation on simulated and real-world marine examples shows that our algorithm frequently produces certifiably optimal RA-SLAM solutions; moreover, even suboptimal estimates are typically within 1-2{\textbackslash}\% of the optimal value.},

  abstract = {Vision-based, route-following algorithms enable autonomous robots to repeat manually taught paths over long distances using inexpensive vision sensors. However, these methods struggle with long-term, outdoor operation due to the challenges of environmental appearance change caused by lighting, weather, and seasons. While techniques exist to address appearance change by using multiple experiences over different environmental conditions, they either provide topological-only localization, require several manually taught experiences in different conditions, or require extensive offline mapping to produce metric localization. For real-world use, we would like to localize metrically to a single manually taught route and gather additional visual experiences during autonomous operations. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-experience localization (MEL) algorithm developed specifically for routefollowing applications; it provides continuous, six-degree-offreedom (6DoF) localization with relative uncertainty to a privileged (manually taught) path using several experiences simultaneously. We validate our algorithm through two experiments: i) an offline performance analysis on a 9km subset of a challenging 27km route-traversal dataset and ii) an online field trial where we demonstrate autonomy on a small 250m loop over the course of a sunny day. Both exhibit significant appearance change due to lighting variation. Through these experiments we show that safe localization can be achieved by bridging the appearance gap.},

To induce robustness against outliers for rotation search, prior work considers truncated least-squares (TLS), which is a non-convex optimization problem, and its semidefinite relaxation (SDR) as a tractable alternative. Whether this SDR is theoretically tight in the presence of noise, outliers, or both has remained largely unexplored. We derive conditions that characterize the tightness of this SDR, showing that the tightness depends on the noise level, the truncation parameters of TLS, and the outlier distribution (random or clustered). In particular, we give a short proof for the tightness in the noiseless and outlier-free case, as opposed to the lengthy analysis of prior work.},

However, solving the large-scale semidefinite relaxations underpinning this approach remains a formidable computational challenge. A dominant cost in many state-of-the-art (Burer-Monteiro factorization-based) certifiable estimation methods is solution verification (testing the global optimality of a given candidate solution), which entails computing a minimum eigenpair of a certain symmetric certificate matrix. In this letter, we show how to significantly accelerate this verification step, and thereby the overall speed of certifiable estimation methods. First, we show that the certificate matrices arising in the Burer-Monteiro approach generically possess spectra that make the verification problem expensive to solve using standard iterative eigenvalue methods. We then show how to address this challenge using preconditioned eigensolvers; specifically, we design a specialized solution verification algorithm based upon the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method together with a simple yet highly effective algebraic preconditioner. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world examples shows that our proposed verification scheme is very effective in practice, accelerating solution verification by up to 280x, and the overall Burer-Monteiro method by up to 16x, versus the standard Lanczos method when applied to relaxations derived from large-scale SLAM benchmarks.},

This article reviews recent progress in SLAM, focusing on advances in the expressive capacity of the environmental models used in SLAM systems (representation) and the performance of the algorithms used to estimate these models from data (inference). A prominent theme of recent SLAM research is the pursuit of environmental representations (including learned representations) that go beyond the classical attributes of geometry and appearance to model properties such as hierarchical organization, affordance, dynamics, and semantics; these advances equip autonomous agents with a more comprehensive understanding of the world, enabling more versatile and intelligent operation. A second major theme is a revitalized interest in the mathematical properties of the SLAM estimation problem itself (including its computational and information-theoretic performance limits); this work has led to the development of novel classes of certifiable and robust inference methods that dramatically improve the reliability of SLAM systems in real-world operation. We survey these advances with an emphasis on their ramifications for achieving robust, long-duration autonomy, and conclude with a discussion of open challenges and a perspective on future research directions.},

An alternative is to conduct inference for a less constrained posterior and project samples to the constrained space through a minimal distance mapping. We formalize and provide a unifying framework for such posterior projections. For theoretical tractability, we initially focus on constrained parameter spaces corresponding to closed and convex subsets of the original space. We then consider non-convex Stiefel manifolds. We provide a general formulation of projected posteriors in a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework. We show that asymptotic properties of the unconstrained posterior are transferred to the projected posterior, leading to asymptotically correct credible intervals.

  abstract = {The MaxCut SDP is one of the most well-known semidefinite programs, and it has many favorable properties. One of its nicest geometric/duality properties is the fact that the vertices of its feasible region correspond exactly to the cuts of a graph, as proved by Laurent and Poljak in 1995. Recall that a boundary point x of a convex set C is called a vertex of C if the normal cone of C at x is full-dimensional. We study how often strict complementarity holds or fails for the MaxCut SDP when a vertex of the feasible region is optimal, i.e., when the SDP relaxation is tight. While strict complementarity is known to hold when the objective function is in the interior of the normal cone at any vertex, we prove that it fails generically at the boundary of such normal cone. In this regard, the MaxCut SDP displays the nastiest behavior possible for a convex optimization problem.},

Our method is based upon a sparse semidefinite relaxation that we prove provides globally optimal PGO solutions under moderate measurement noise (matching the guarantees enjoyed by the state-of-the-art centralized methods), but is amenable to distributed optimization using the low-rank Riemannian Staircase framework. To implement the Riemannian Staircase in the distributed setting, we develop Riemannian block coordinate descent (RBCD), a novel method for (locally) minimizing a function over a product of Riemannian manifolds. We also propose the first distributed solution verification and saddle escape methods to certify the global optimality of critical points recovered via RBCD, and to descend from suboptimal critical points (if necessary). All components of our approach are inherently decentralized: they require only local communication, provide privacy protection, and are easily parallelizable. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method correctly recovers globally optimal solutions under moderate noise, and outperforms alternative distributed techniques in terms of solution precision and convergence speed.},

Real-world applications demand multi-robot SLAM systems to be robust to perceptual aliasing and to operate under limited communication bandwidth; moreover, it is desirable for these systems to capture semantic information to enable high-level decision-making and spatial artificial intelligence. This article presents {\textbackslash}mathsfKimera-Multi , a multi-robot system that: 1) is robust and capable of identifying and rejecting incorrect inter- and intrarobot loop closures resulting from perceptual aliasing; 2) is fully distributed and only relies on local (peer-to-peer) communication to achieve distributed localization and mapping; and 3) builds a globally consistent metric-semantic 3-D mesh model of the environment in real time, where faces of the mesh are annotated with semantic labels. {\textbackslash}mathsfKimera-Multi is implemented by a team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local trajectory estimate and a local mesh using {\textbackslash}mathsfKimera . When communication is available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose graph optimization protocol based on a distributed graduated nonconvexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques. We demonstrate {\textbackslash}mathsfKimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800 m per robot). The experiments show that {\textbackslash}mathsfKimera-Multi : 1) outperforms the state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy; 2) achieves estimation errors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed; 3) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth; 4) produces accurate metric-semantic 3-D meshes; and 5) is modular and can also be used for standard 3-D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3-D mesh).},

As a result, if we obtain sufficient independent bearing measurements, our method can determine bearing-pose correspondences and furthermore recover initial relative poses between robots with optimality guarantee. We compare our method with local optimization methods on extensive simulations under different noise levels to show our advantage in global optimality and robustness.

In this paper, we extend our recent work on a convex optimization approach for hand-eye calibration to the case where one of the sensors cannot observe the scale of its translational motion (e.g., a monocular camera observing an unmapped environment). We prove that our technique is able to provide a certifiably globally optimal solution to both the known- and unknown-scale variants of hand-eye calibration, provided that the measurement noise is bounded. Herein, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the problem, show the tightness and stability of our convex relaxation, and demonstrate the optimality and speed of our algorithm through experiments with synthetic data.},

However, most non-minimal solvers rely on least squares formulations, and, as a result, are brittle against outliers. While a standard approach to regain robustness against outliers is to use robust cost functions, the latter typically introduce other non-convexities, preventing the use of existing non-minimal solvers. In this paper, we enable the simultaneous use of non-minimal solvers and robust estimation by providing a general-purpose approach for robust global estimation, which can be applied to any problem where a non-minimal solver is available for the outlier-free case. To this end, we leverage the Black-Rangarajan duality between robust estimation and outlier processes (which has been traditionally applied to early vision problems), and show that graduated nonconvexity (GNC) can be used in conjunction with non-minimal solvers to compute robust solutions, without requiring an initial guess. Although GNC's global optimality cannot be guaranteed, we demonstrate the empirical robustness of the resulting robust non-minimal solvers in applications, including point cloud and mesh registration, pose graph optimization, and image-based object pose estimation (also called shape alignment). Our solvers are robust to 70-80\% of outliers, outperform RANSAC, are more accurate than specialized local solvers, and faster than specialized global solvers. We also propose the first certifiably optimal nonminimal solver for shape alignment using SOS relaxation.},

Our first contribution is to show that --for a broad class of geometric perception problems-- TLS estimation can be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the minimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the nonconvex TLS problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis reduction to significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite program (SDP) resulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness. Our third contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certifiers from the lens of sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g., returned by fast heuristics such as RANSAC or graduated non-convexity). Our dual certifiers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex feasibility SDP. Numerical experiments across different perception problems, including single rotation averaging, shape alignment, 3D point cloud and mesh registration, and high-integrity satellite pose estimation, demonstrate the tightness of our relaxations, the correctness of the certification, and the scalability of the proposed dual certifiers to large problems, beyond the reach of current SDP solvers.},

  abstract = {We propose the first fast and certifiable algorithm for the registration of two sets of three-dimensional (3-D) points in the presence of large amounts of outlier correspondences. A certifiable algorithm is one that attempts to solve an intractable optimization problem (e.g., robust estimation with outliers) and provides readily checkable conditions to verify if the returned solution is optimal (e.g., if the algorithm produced the most accurate estimate in the face of outliers) or bound its suboptimality or accuracy. Toward this goal, we first reformulate the registration problem using a truncated least squares (TLS) cost that makes the estimation insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. Then, we provide a general graph-theoretic framework to decouple scale, rotation, and translation estimation, which allows solving in cascade for the three transformations. Despite the fact that each subproblem (scale, rotation, and translation estimation) is still nonconvex and combinatorial in nature, we show that 1) TLS scale and (component-wise) translation estimation can be solved in polynomial time via an adaptive voting scheme, 2) TLS rotation estimation can be relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP) and the relaxation is tight, even in the presence of extreme outlier rates, and 3) the graph-theoretic framework allows drastic pruning of outliers by finding the maximum clique. We name the resulting algorithm TEASER (Truncated least squares Estimation And SEmidefinite Relaxation). While solving large SDP relaxations is typically slow, we develop a second fast and certifiable algorithm, named TEASER++, that uses graduated nonconvexity to solve the rotation subproblem and leverages Douglas-Rachford Splitting to efficiently certify global optimality. For both algorithms, we provide theoretical bounds on the estimation errors, which are the first of their kind for robust registration problems. Moreover, we test their performance on standard benchmarks, object detection datasets, and the 3DMatch scan matching dataset, and show that 1) both algorithms dominate the state-of-the-art (e.g., RANSAC, branch-\&-bound, heuristics) and are robust to more than {\textbackslash}text99\% outliers when the scale is known, 2) TEASER++ can run in milliseconds and it is currently the fastest robust registration algorithm, and 3) TEASER++ is so robust it can also solve problems without correspondences (e.g., hypothesizing all-to-all correspondences), where it largely outperforms ICP and it is more accurate than Go-ICP while being orders of magnitude faster. We release a fast open-source C++ implementation of TEASER++.},

  abstract = {Positioning and mapping can be conducted accurately by state-of-the-art state estimation methods. However, reliability of these methods is largely based on avoiding degeneracy that can arise from cases such as scarcity of texture features for vision sensors and lack of geometrical structures for range sensors. Since the problems are inevitably solved in uncontrived environments where sensors cannot function with their highest quality, it is important for the estimation methods to be robust to degeneracy. This paper proposes an online method to mitigate for degeneracy in optimizationbased problems, through analysis of geometric structure of the problem constraints. The method determines and separates degenerate directions in the state space, and only partially solves the problem in well-conditioned directions. We demonstrate utility of this method with data from a camera and lidar sensor pack to estimate 6-DOF ego-motion. Experimental results show that the system is able to improve estimation in environmentally degenerate cases, resulting in enhanced robustness for online positioning and mapping.},

The six-point minimal solver for the GEM has poor numerical stability and applies only for a minimal number of points. Existing nonminimal solvers for GEM estimation rely on either local optimization or relinearization techniques, which impedes high accuracy in common scenarios. Our proposed nonminimal solver minimizes the sum of squared residuals by reformulating the problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. The globally optimal solution is thus obtained by a semidefinite relaxation. The algorithm retrieves certifiably globally optimal solutions to the original non-convex problem in polynomial time. We also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions to recover the optimal GEM from the relaxed problems. The improved performance is demonstrated over experiments on both synthetic and real multi-camera systems.},

  abstract = {We employ chordal decomposition to reformulate a large and sparse semidefinite program (SDP), either in primal or dual standard form, into an equivalent SDP with smaller positive semidefinite (PSD) constraints. In contrast to previous approaches, the decomposed SDP is suitable for the application of first-order operator-splitting methods, enabling the development of efficient and scalable algorithms. In particular, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve decomposed primal- and dual-standard-form SDPs. Each iteration of such ADMM algorithms requires a projection onto an affine subspace, and a set of projections onto small PSD cones that can be computed in parallel. We also formulate the homogeneous self-dual embedding (HSDE) of a primal-dual pair of decomposed SDPs, and extend a recent ADMM-based algorithm to exploit the structure of our HSDE. The resulting HSDE algorithm has the same leading-order computational cost as those for the primal or dual problems only, with the advantage of being able to identify infeasible problems and produce an infeasibility certificate. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source MATLAB solver CDCS. Numerical experiments on a range of large-scale SDPs demonstrate the computational advantages of the proposed methods compared to common state-of-the-art solvers.},

  abstract = {Chordal and factor-width decomposition methods for semidefinite programming and polynomial optimization have recently enabled the analysis and control of large-scale linear systems and medium-scale nonlinear systems. Chordal decomposition exploits the sparsity of semidefinite matrices in a semidefinite program (SDP), in order to formulate an equivalent SDP with smaller semidefinite constraints that can be solved more efficiently. Factor-width decompositions, instead, relax or strengthen SDPs with dense semidefinite matrices into more tractable problems, trading feasibility or optimality for lower computational complexity. This article reviews recent advances in large-scale semidefinite and polynomial optimization enabled by these two types of decomposition, highlighting connections and differences between them. We also demonstrate that chordal and factor-width decompositions allow for significant computational savings on a range of classical problems from control theory, and on more recent problems from machine learning. Finally, we outline possible directions for future research that have the potential to facilitate the efficient optimization-based study of increasingly complex large-scale dynamical systems.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many large-scale systems have inherent structures that can be exploited to facilitate their analysis and design. This thesis investigates how chordal graph properties can be used to develop scalable methods for solving three classes of problems: sparse semidefinite programs (SDPs), distributed control of networked systems, and sum-of-squares (SOS) programs. By exploiting the properties of chordal graphs and sparse positive semidefinite matrices, we present decomposition methods that are able to scale these problems to much larger instances.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The first part of this thesis proposes a new conversion framework for large-scale SDPs characterized by chordal sparsity. This framework is analogous to standard conversion techniques for interior-point methods, but is more suitable for the application of first-order methods. We develop efficient algorithms based on the {$<$}em{$>$}alternating direction method of multipliers{$<$}/em{$>$} (ADMM) for sparse SDPs in either primal or dual standard form, and for their homogeneous self-dual embedding. The algorithms are made available in the open-source conic solver CDCS. CDCS is the first open-source first-order solver that exploits chordal decomposition and can detect infeasible problems. We demonstrate the performance of CDCS in standard analysis problems of large-scale networked systems.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The second part of this thesis is concerned with solution scalability and model privacy in distributed control of networked systems. Specifically, we apply chordal decomposition in sparse Lyapunov-type linear matrix inequalities arising from structured stabilization and optimal decentralized control of networked systems. We introduce a sequential method based on the clique-intersection property of a clique tree for structured stabilization. This strategy greatly improves the computational efficiency for large-scale sparse systems. In addition, we propose an ADMM algorithm that can maintain model privacy when solving the optimal decentralized control problem. {$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Finally, we consider large-scale SOS programs. We identify an inherent partial orthogonality in the formulation when recasting general SOS programs using the standard monomial basis. In addition, we extend the well-established chordal decomposition/completion results for sparse positive semidefinite matrices to a subset of SOS matrices. Using a new graph-theoretic viewpoint, we build an explicit relationship between chordal decomposition in SOS optimization and two other recent techniques --- DSOS and SDSOS optimization. We demonstrate that chordal decomposition can bring significant speed-ups for large-scale sparse SOS programs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Precisely, we show how a ``diagonal plus low rank'' structure implied by partial orthogonality can be exploited to project efficiently the iterates of a recent ADMM algorithm for generic conic programs onto the set defined by the affine constraints of the SDP. The resulting algorithm, implemented as a new package in the solver CDCS, is tested on a range of large-scale SOS programs arising from constrained polynomial optimization problems and from Lyapunov stability analysis of polynomial dynamical systems.
