  abstract = {Finding the relative pose between two calibrated views ranks among the most fundamental geometric vision problems. It therefore appears as somewhat a surprise that a globally optimal solver that minimizes a properly defined energy over non-minimal correspondence sets and in the original space of relative transformations has yet to be discovered. This, notably, is the contribution of the present paper. We formulate the problem as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP), which can be converted into a Semidefinite Program (SDP) using Shor's convex relaxation. While a theoretical proof for the tightness of this relaxation remains open, we prove through exhaustive validation on both simulated and real experiments that our approach always finds and certifies (a-posteriori) the global optimum of the cost function.},

This problem is non-convex due to the presence of rotational constraints, making traditional local optimization methods prone to getting stuck in local minima. This paper addresses finding the globally optimal transformation in various 3D registration problems by a unified formulation that integrates common geometric registration modalities (namely point-to-point, point-to-line and point-to-plane). This formulation renders the optimization problem independent of both the number and nature of the correspondences.},

  abstract = {This paper tackles the resolution of the Relative Pose problem with optimality guarantees by stating it as an optimization problem over the set of essential matrices that minimizes the squared epipolar error. We relax this non-convex problem with its Shor's relaxation, a convex program that can be solved by off-the-shelf tools. We follow the empirical observation that redundant but independent constraints tighten the relaxation. For that, we leverage equivalent definitions of the set of essential matrices based on the translation vectors between the cameras. Overconstrained characterizations of the set of essential matrices are derived by the combination of these definitions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, our proposal is empirically proved to remain tight and to require only 7 milliseconds to be solved even for the overconstrained formulations, finding the optimal solution under a wide variety of configurations, including highly noisy data and outliers. The solver cannot certify the solution only in very extreme cases, e.g. noise 100 pix and number of pair-wise correspondences under 15. The proposal is thus faster than other overconstrained formulations while being faster than the minimal ones, making it suitable for real-world applications that require optimality certification.},

Thus SDP has enabled us to efficiently solve the Lagrangian relaxation and find good approximate solutions for these hard, possibly nonconvex, Q2P. This area has generated a lot of research recently. This has resulted in many strong and elegant theorems that describe the strength/performance of the bounds obtained from solving relaxations of these Q2P.},

However, the correspondence is difficult to acquire, especially for unified robotteams.

Then, we relax the original nonconvex problem into a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem and obtain a certifiably global optimum. As a result, if we obtain sufficient independent bearing measurements, our method can determine bearing-pose correspondences and furthermore recover initial relative poses between robots with optimality guarantee. We compare our method with local optimization methods on extensive simulations under different noise levels to show our advantage in global optimality and robustness. Real-world experiments are conducted to show the practicality and robustness.},

We investigate the use of a truncated least squares (TLS) cost function, which is known to be robust to outliers, but leads to hard, nonconvex, and nonsmooth optimization problems. Our first contribution is to show that \textendash for a broad class of geometric perception problems\textendash{} TLS estimation can be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the minimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the nonconvex TLS problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis reduction to significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite program (SDP) resulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness. Our third contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certifiers from the lens of sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g., returned by fast heuristics such as RANSAC or graduated non-convexity). Our dual certifiers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex feasibility SDP. Numerical experiments across different perception problems, including single rotation averaging, shape alignment, 3D point cloud and mesh registration, and high-integrity satellite pose estimation, demonstrate the tightness of our relaxations, the correctness of the certification, and the scalability of the proposed dual certifiers to large problems, beyond the reach of current SDP solvers.},
