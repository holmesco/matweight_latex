Given a nominal value of the parameter at which the SDP relaxation is exact, we study conditions (and quantitative bounds) under which the relaxation will continue to be exact as the parameter moves in a neighborhood around the nominal value. Our framework captures a wide array of statistical estimation problems including tensor principal component analysis, rotation synchronization, orthogonal Procrustes, camera triangulation and resectioning, essential matrix estimation, system identiﬁcation, and approximate GCD. Our results can also be used to analyze the stability of SOS relaxations of general polynomial optimization problems.},

Such problems have appeared in the literature of a diverse set of ﬁelds including system identiﬁcation and control, Euclidean embedding, and collaborative ﬁltering. Although speciﬁc instances can often be solved with specialized algorithms, the general aﬃne rank minimization problem is NP-hard because it contains vector cardinality minimization as a special case. In this paper, we show that if a certain restricted isometry property holds for the linear transformation deﬁning the constraints, the minimum-rank solution can be recovered by solving a convex optimization problem, namely, the minimization of the nuclear norm over the given aﬃne space. We present several random ensembles of equations where the restricted isometry property holds with overwhelming probability, provided the codimension of the subspace is suﬃciently large. The techniques used in our analysis have strong parallels in the compressed sensing framework. We discuss how aﬃne rank minimization generalizes this preexisting concept and outline a dictionary relating concepts from cardinality minimization to those of rank minimization. We also discuss several algorithmic approaches to minimizing the nuclear norm and illustrate our results with numerical examples.},

We relax this non-convex problem with its Shor’s relaxation, a convex program that can be solved by off-the-shelf tools. We follow the empirical observation that redundant but independent constraints tighten the relaxation. For that, we leverage equivalent deﬁnitions of the set of essential matrices based on the translation vectors between the cameras. Overconstrained characterizations of the set of essential matrices are derived by the combination of these deﬁnitions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, our proposal is empirically proved to remain tight and to require only 7 milliseconds to be solved even for the overconstrained formulations, ﬁnding the optimal solution under a wide variety of conﬁgurations, including highly noisy data and outliers. The solver cannot certify the solution only in very extreme cases, e.g. noise 100 pix and number of pair-wise correspondences under 15. The proposal is thus faster than other overconstrained formulations while being faster than the minimal ones, making it suitable for real-world applications that require optimality certiﬁcation.},

Lagrangian relaxations often provide good approximate solutions to these hard problems. Such relaxations are equivalent to semidefinite programming relaxations.

For several special cases of QQP, e.g., convex programs and trust region subproblems, the Lagrangian relaxation provides the exact optimal value, i.e., there is a zero duality gap. However, this is not true for the general QQP, or even the QQP with two convex constraints, but a nonconvex objective.

In this paper we consider a certain QQP where the quadratic constraints correspond to the matrix orthogonality condition XXT=I. For this problem we show that the Lagrangian dual based on relaxing the constraints XXT=I and the seemingly redundant constraints XTX =I has a zero duality gap. This result has natural applications to quadratic assignment and graph partitioning problems, as well as the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of the largest eigenvalues of a matrix. We also show that the technique of relaxing quadratic matrix constraints can be used to obtain a strengthened semidefinite relaxation for the max-cut problem.},

	abstract = {Slater's condition -- existence of a "strictly feasible solution" -- is a common assumption in conic optimization. Without strict feasibility, first-order optimality conditions may be meaningless, the dual problem may yield little information about the primal, and small changes in the data may render the problem infeasible. Hence, failure of strict feasibility can negatively impact off-the-shelf numerical methods, such as primal-dual interior point methods, in particular. New optimization modelling techniques and convex relaxations for hard nonconvex problems have shown that the loss of strict feasibility is a more pronounced phenomenon than has previously been realized. In this text, we describe various reasons for the loss of strict feasibility, whether due to poor modelling choices or (more interestingly) rich underlying structure, and discuss ways to cope with it and, in many pronounced cases, how to use it as an advantage. In large part, we emphasize the facial reduction preprocessing technique due to its mathematical elegance, geometric transparency, and computational potential.},

	abstract = {The semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has proven to be extremely strong for many hard discrete optimization problems. This is in particular true for the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), arguably one of the hardest NP-hard discrete optimization problems. There are several difficulties that arise in efficiently solving the SDP relaxation, e.g.,{\textasciitilde}increased dimension; inefficiency of the current primal-dual interior point solvers in terms of both time and accuracy; and difficulty and high expense in adding cutting plane constraints. We propose using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the SDP relaxation. This first order approach allows for inexpensive iterations, a method of cheaply obtaining low rank solutions, as well a trivial way of adding cutting plane inequalities. When compared to current approaches and current best available bounds we obtain remarkable robustness, efficiency and improved bounds.},

The method uses an operator splitting method, the alternating directions method of multipliers, to solve the homogeneous self-dual embedding, an equivalent feasibility problem involving ﬁnding a nonzero point in the intersection of a subspace and a cone. This approach has several favorable properties. Compared to interior-point methods, ﬁrst-order methods scale to very large problems, at the cost of requiring more time to reach very high accuracy. Compared to other ﬁrst-order methods for cone programs, our approach ﬁnds both primal and dual solutions when available or a certiﬁcate of infeasibility or unboundedness otherwise, is parameter free, and the per-iteration cost of the method is the same as applying a splitting method to the primal or dual alone. We discuss efﬁcient implementation of the method in detail, including direct and indirect methods for computing projection onto the subspace, scaling the original problem data, and stopping criteria. We describe an open-source implementation, which handles the usual (symmetric) nonnegative, second-order, and semideﬁnite cones as well as the (non-self-dual) exponential and power cones and their duals. We report numerical results that show speedups over interior-point cone solvers for large problems, and scaling to very large general cone programs.},

For convex optimization problems, it is well known that the algorithm generates iterates that converge to a solution, provided that it exists. If a solution does not exist, then the iterates diverge. Nevertheless, we show that they yield conclusive information regarding problem infeasibility for optimization problems with linear or quadratic objective functions and conic constraints, which includes quadratic, second-order cone, and semideﬁnite programs. In particular, we show that in the limit the iterates either satisfy a set of ﬁrst-order optimality conditions or produce a certiﬁcate of either primal or dual infeasibility. Based on these results, we propose termination criteria for detecting primal and dual infeasibility.},

	abstract = {We employ chordal decomposition to reformulate a large and sparse semidefinite program (SDP), either in primal or dual standard form, into an equivalent SDP with smaller positive semidefinite (PSD) constraints. In contrast to previous approaches, the decomposed SDP is suitable for the application of first-order operator-splitting methods, enabling the development of efficient and scalable algorithms. In particular, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve decomposed primal- and dual-standard-form SDPs. Each iteration of such ADMM algorithms requires a projection onto an affine subspace, and a set of projections onto small PSD cones that can be computed in parallel. We also formulate the homogeneous self-dual embedding (HSDE) of a primal-dual pair of decomposed SDPs, and extend a recent ADMM-based algorithm to exploit the structure of our HSDE. The resulting HSDE algorithm has the same leading-order computational cost as those for the primal or dual problems only, with the advantage of being able to identify infeasible problems and produce an infeasibility certificate. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source MATLAB solver CDCS. Numerical experiments on a range of large-scale SDPs demonstrate the computational advantages of the proposed methods compared to common state-of-the-art solvers.},

For each class of approaches we provide a high-level exposition, an entry-point to the corresponding literature, and examples drawn from machine learning, control, or robotics. We also present a list of software packages that implement many of the techniques discussed in the paper.
